<p>Fastfood Web App, excellent for any kind of restaurant!</p>

<p>You can find the most popular options on our Home screen, where you can just simply click to select the items for your order.</p>

<p>After that, click on "Revisar pedido" to review your order details and then click on "Finalizar pedido" to go to checkout.</p>

<p>Here you can choose which way you prefer to pay, write your name and any comments you'd like to be taken into account. Then, just click on "Finalizar pedido" to see the option to print your recipe. After that, you just need to wait for your name to turn green on our "Retirada" page (top-right corner of the screen).</p>

<p>On our "Cozinha" page (staff only), our top staff will rapidly take best care of your order and change its status in real time from "Preparando" to "Pronto" (green). Finally you're ready to enjoy your meal! :D</p>
